-Another project I've worked on is a Google Ads Analyzer that runs on Node.js & casperJS to scrape google ads down to JSON and then analyze them for lookalike URLs in order to find ad scammers. Take a look at it [here](https://github.com/waltmaisel/Google-Ad-Analyzer).

-My baccalaureate thesis at NCF was based on a constraint based grammar for contrapuntal music written in LISP named [Asclepius](https://github.com/waltmaisel/Asclepius). It can both analyze & compose 1st species counterpoint in two voices.
